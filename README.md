# TCC_Library

GeoCommunication is a library developed in Java that provides to Android developers a set of resources to create applications where a device can send a message to another one since the first is "pointing" at the second. On the other words, the other devices are not in that direction, but sharing the same network and application, won't receive the message. 
Follows a short description about the library functionalities:
* creation of network among the devices that will be delivered for just one of them through the access point feature enabled on its operating system;
* an application protocol to provide the communication inside the network;
* a set of functions based on motion and position sensors to calculate the range of message reception.

To clarify its usability, it's possible for example create a kind of a virtual paintball.
